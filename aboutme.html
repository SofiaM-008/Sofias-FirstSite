<div style="padding: 15px; text-align: left;"><h1>Get To Know Me!</h1>
<p>To create my About Me page, I added a header that says “About Me” and a navigation bar with links to other pages like Home, About Me, Favorite Things, and Contact Me so visitors can easily move around my site. I also linked to my external CSS file so I could style the page and make it look more professional. In the main section, I added a heading that says “Get To Know Me!” along with several paragraphs introducing myself. I included images next to the text and floated them left or right to make the layout more interesting. These images have borders, rounded corners, and slight rotations to give the page a creative look. I used the paragraphs to talk about my background, my dad’s influence on my design journey, my hobbies like cooking, baking, and playing Nintendo games, and my goals as a designer. I also added a YouTube video so visitors could watch it directly on the page. Overall, the About Me page combines text, images, and media to introduce myself and share a more in depth explanation of who I am to those visiting my site.</p>

<p>My name is Sofia Maltos. I was born in Oceanside, California on May 8th, 2008, and I’m currently a senior at El Camino High School. Over the years, I’ve grown passionate about creativity, especially through graphic and web design. I’ve developed strong skills in Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator, which I use to take my ideas and bring them to life visually. More recently, I’ve also become interested in learning HTML and CSS, since web design offers another way for me to share my creativity. Design has become more than just something I do for fun—it’s a way for me to challenge myself and continually grow as a creator.</p>
<img src="images/NINTENDO IMG copy.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="Nintendo" style="float: right; margin-left: 15px; border: 4px solid white; border-radius:15px; transform: rotate(-4deg);"/>
<p>My interest in design started because of my dad, who always loved the idea of working from home and building something for yourself. He believed in doing work every day that pushes your creativity and tests your limits. We often sat together in coffee shops talking about design, inspiration, and ideas. One day, he gave me a sketchbook made by the well-known graphic designer Aaron James Draplin, and he encouraged me to carry it everywhere. That gift made me realize how important it is to capture ideas, no matter how small, and it inspired me to start taking design more seriously. Those conversations and moments with my dad played a big role in shaping who I am as a designer today.</p>
<img src="images/Baking img.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="baking" style = "float: left; margin-right: 15px; border: 4px solid white; border-radius: 15px; transform: rotate(4deg);"/>
<p>Outside of school, I enjoy activities that also connect to my creative side. Cooking and baking allow me to experiment and create something unique, much like designing does. Playing video games, especially Nintendo games, inspires me through their visuals, characters, and storytelling. I also spend a lot of time in Adobe Illustrator, not just for assignments but for fun—testing out new tools and exploring different design styles. These hobbies keep me inspired and help me see creativity from different angles.</p>
<p>Looking toward the future, I want to continue improving my design skills and pushing myself creatively. My goal is to combine my knowledge of programs like Photoshop and Illustrator with web design tools like HTML and CSS to create work that is both artistic and functional. More than anything, I want to follow the path my dad inspired in me: to do something I love every day, to push my creativity further, and to use design as a way to express myself while making an impact.</p>
