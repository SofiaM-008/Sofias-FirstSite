  <h3>Favorite Things</h3>
  <p>My favorite things all revolve around creativity. Whether it’s designing, brainstorming, or experimenting with new ideas, I love anything that lets me think outside the box. Following a strict set of directions? Not really my style — I’m all about breaking boundaries and making something uniquely mine. Creativity isn’t just a hobby; it’s a way of life and my favorite way to spend time.</p>
