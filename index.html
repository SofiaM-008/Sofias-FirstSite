<div style="padding: 15px; text-align: center;"><h1>Welcome To My Website</h1>
<p>To create my homepage, I started by making the HTML body to set up the structure of my site. I then added some CSS styling, including a hover effect so that when you move your mouse over the text in my navigation menu, it pops out-letting you know which option you're selecting. For the navigation, I created a div called "headerdiv" that contains links in the menu bar. Each link brings you to a different page on my site (Home, About Me, Favorite Things, Contact Me, etc.). In my main welcome section, I included an "h1" heading that says “Welcome to my website” along with a couple of paragraphs introducing myself. I centered this text and added padding to give it more space. Below that, I added an image of a computer. I also used alt="Computer" so that if the image doesn’t load, the text “Computer” will appear instead. Next, I created three separate content boxes using a div class called "threecolumns". Each box gives a short description of one of my pages, along with a link that takes you directly to that page. Finally, at the bottom of the page, I added a footer div that displays my copyright information so it can be seen across all pages of my site.</p>
